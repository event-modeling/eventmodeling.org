## [Discord](#discord) {#discord}

[![discord](discord.png)](https://discord.gg/Sw4MvagftJ)

We have moved our community from Slack to Discord. The Slack channel was created to set an environment where discussions could happen and allow a new avenue for the practice to get adopted. That purpose is better served by Discord which allows community members to interact and coordinate better. You can join the community through this link:

## [Book](#book) {#book}

Martin Dilger's book on Event Modeling and Event Sourcing is available for purchase [here](https://leanpub.com/event-modeling-and-event-sourcing). It explains both concepts but it's complete enough on Event Modeling to be used as a way to learn the practice.

## [Newsletter](#newsletter)

The [weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.nebulit.de) is a great way to stay up to date with the latest news in the Event Modeling community. It will summarize many topics from the community and the podcast. This should be a great way to keep up if you don't have time to listen to the podcast or keep up with the discord discussions.

## [Laptop Stickers](#laptop-stickers) {#laptop-stickers}

You can send these to your own printer to save on shipping and other costs.
